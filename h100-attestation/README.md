# Important

This is a copy of https://github.com/Azure/az-cgpu-onboarding/blob/main/Confidential-GPU-H100-Onboarding-(CMK-for-Linux).md

I just modified `step-2-attestation.sh` because it was not fully working in this ubuntu image.

## Run

Simply go to `cgpu-h100-auto-onboarding-linux/cgpu-onboarding-package/` and run `bash step-2-attestation.sh`
